# Define sensors to be read. Mapping of sensor IDs.
# Key is sensor id, value is a mapping describing
# the attributes to read, what influx field to use for the
# sensor and tag assignments for the datapoints.
#
# When reading DS18x20 sensors, it is recommended
# to use "/lateststemp", since owfs2influx begins
# each cycle by triggering simultaneos temperature
# conversion on all sensors.
